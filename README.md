# Daily Planner

A complete To-Do App made in Flutter for Android, iOS and Web with Firebase.

This app's features:
- Cloud synced todo lists via Firebase in realtime
- User authentication and guaranteed sync of task management across supported devices
- Each account has its own private data that they authenticate into to view and modify
- Notifications for reminders to complete the tasks
- Priority queue management of tasks lightning fast from the CRUD of Cloud Firestore
- Offline app data, you have your tasks persist in the app even if you aren't connected to the internet
- FOSS, it is Free and and Open Source Software with an * asterisk because of Firebase use
- Cool UI and UX (imo)
- Light / Dark mode with state management
- (!) Dotenv and every key or stuff shown is deliberate for the project and was required.

## Installation Instructions

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/xAlpharax/daily_planner/releases) page of the project and download the `.apk`, then install it. (I'm sorry but for the other platforms supported you will have to compile it yourself)

## Demo

## Compiling Instructions

1. Make sure to have the Flutter SDK installed and pointed at by your IDE.
2. Open the repository with your IDE, go to pubspec.yaml and perform `pub get`
3. Select a platform to test the application on.
4. Hit Run.
5. ???
6. Profit.

More simply put:

```bash
# make sure flutter is installed and you can use it in cli like:
#flutter --version

# make sure you are in the appropriate directory `daily_planner`
# the output of pwd should be the project directory `daily_planner`
#pwd

# run pub get
flutter pub get

# you should be able to build these three with no issue
flutter build apk
flutter build ios
flutter build web
```
